Our WordPress plugin allows you to display a label with the
nutritional values of your recipes in the entries and pages of your blog.

The information includes data in kilocalories, carbohydrates, sugars,
fats, proteins, cholesterol, vitamins and minerals. In addition, give the
Recommended Daily Amount (CDR) of each nutrient contained in 100 grams of recipe *.

**Your nutritional information label in just two steps**

Enter the ingredients of your recipe. As you type the name of each ingredient a list
of suggestions is displayed.
To finish you just insert the shortcode indicated inside the text of your entry or page.
Nutrition information is automatically calculated and displayed on a perfectly formatted label.

== Installation ==

Once Installed you must activate the plugin. Once active a couple of additional
menus should appear to your wordpress management site:
Recipes and Info_nutricional.

In the menu "info_nutricional" you must enter your email address and set the language for the label
and the user interface. English is set by default.

=Go to the menu "Recipes"=

You already have the plugin installed and configured. Add a recipe and enter the ingredients.
A dropdown menu with the ingredient names will appear. Once you publish the recipe, you can use the provided
shortcode in your posts and pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The data of the nutritional information label are calculated in our database from the recipe entered by the user. Our database contains information from various sources of public information such as the European Union and the US Department of Agriculture. *

=How much does the plugin cost?=

At the moment the plugin is in beta stage of development and is free. If in the future we decide to adopt a pricing policy for the use of the plugin, all the tags that you have generated with the plugin will continue to work correctly on your blog even if you do not upgrade to a paid version.

=What would happen to my tags if Infonutricional.net stops providing service?=

All tags you generate are hosted on your blog. If for some reason we stop serving all the tags you have generated will be displayed correctly.
